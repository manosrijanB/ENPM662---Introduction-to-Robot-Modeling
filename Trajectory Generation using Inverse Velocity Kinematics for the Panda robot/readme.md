The assignment involves computing the inverse position kinematics of the Panda robot to draw a circle using the inverse velocity kinematics approach.

The task is to compute the inverse position kinematics of the Panda robot to draw a circle of radius 10 cm within 5 seconds using the inverse velocity kinematics approach.
The robot’s end-effector has a pen mounted along the ‘z-axis’ of the end-effector frame, and joint 3 is locked (𝜃3 = 0), making the Jacobian matrix a 6x6 square matrix.
The initial joint angles configuration is given as q(at t=0) = [0.0, 0.0, pi/2, 0.0, pi, 0.0]T, with the pen in contact with the wall at point ‘S’ and perpendicular to it.
The assignment requires setting up the Jacobian matrix, deriving the desired circle trajectory and velocity, obtaining joint angular velocities, performing numerical integration, and plotting the end-effector position to visualize the circle.
