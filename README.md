# ENPM662 - Introduction to Robot Modeling
 This course introduces basic principles for modeling a robot, including forward and inverse kinematics, velocity kinematics, Jacobians, dynamics, planning, and contact. It primarily considers serial open-chain robots, but also touches on parallel robots, closed chain systems, aerial and mobile robots, hyper- redundant systems, and grasping
